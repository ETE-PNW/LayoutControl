# LayoutControl

This repository holds configuration files and documentation for the control of ETE-PNW's modular layout. For the first few years of the layout's operation, there was not much need for configuration, as the layout itself didn't have and computerized control capability. What little was needed, was usually contained either in structured wiring, or in one of the Marklin CS2 control stations.

This, however, is changing. The layout has now reached a size where a block signalling system becomes a necessity:

* The layout is big enough that not all of it is visible from the control podium, which increases the risks of collisions.
* During train shows, the members running trains are often distracted by interactions with the audience and other members.
* The layout is big enough, and has enough tunnels, so that there can be times where not many trains are visible to the visitors. More simultaneous trains are highly desirable.
* New upcoming modules (like for example the staging yard) will require some interaction between yard and mainline operations. This will need protection to avoid accidents, which are quite likely due to miscommunications and members' lack of familiarity with more complex train operations.

Also, it is fun!

Several options for layout control are being evaluated in a series of Experiments. These are documented in the [Experiments](Experiments) tree, ordered by time.
